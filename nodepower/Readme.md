<h4>NodePower - Monitor your Node's Power Consumption</h4>
<p>
NodePower enables you to view your node's power consumption for any time period stored in the database.  Nodepower uses a "round-robin" database to store up to years worth of data.  Once you install NodePower it begins keeping a database.  You can use the web browser to view charts of any time period after installing NodePower.

<p>
Installing and using NodePower will give you an excellent introduction to Linux "devops".  You will learn about Linux server software systems and architecture, scripting for Internet applications, and displaying information in a web page.  Additionally you will learn about Raspberry Pies, GPIO, and I2C sensors.
